# Supply Chain & Product Performance Analysis
## Project Overview :
- This project analyzes the supply chain and product performance.
The dataset contains key information related to product sales,
customer demographics, stock levels, shipping costs, lead times, and supplier details. 
The analysis aimed to provide insights into product performance, improve supply chain efficiency, 
and better understand customer behavior through interactive Tableau dashboards.
## Objectives :
- Analyze Product Performance
- Assess Supply Chain Efficiency
- Understand Customer Demographics.
## Tools Used :
- **Data Preparation:** Excel is used to clean and prepare the dataset.
- **Visualization:** Tableau creates interactive dashboards and tells a story with the data.
## Key insights:
- **Product Performance Dashboard:** Skin care products lead in both product sales and revenue,
with mid-range prices proving to be the most successful, offering the best balance between affordability and profitability.
- **Supply Chain Efficiency Dashboard:** Supplier 2 needs to improve its quality control to reduce its high defect rate of 51.96%,
 while Supplier 3 with a low defect rate of 36.99% highlights its strong quality standards and reliability.
- **Customer Demographics Dashboard:**  The "Unknown" category, with the highest number of products sold and revenue,
 suggests missing or improperly categorized customer data. Despite this, female customers, with lower revenue but identifiable demographics,
 come next in importance.
## Actionable Insights:
- Fix data gaps in the "Unknown" category and target marketing efforts on the Female group, which makes up 21.36% of revenue.
- Actionable insight is to focus on leveraging the strong customer demand and high revenue from skin care products for strategic business efforts.
- Additionally, addressing and improving the incomplete or misclassified customer data in
 the "Unknown" category can enable a more comprehensive understanding of the customer base.
## Conclusion:
- Prioritize smaller orders with Supplier 3 for faster fulfillment and lower defect rates,
while negotiating better shipping rates with Carrier B and focusing on quality improvements with Supplier 2.
Expand the Skin Care line in mid-range segments to maximize strong demand and revenue, and improve targeted marketing with accurate customer data.
